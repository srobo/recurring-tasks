summary: Order volunteer shirts for the competition

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: volunteer-coordination

description: >-
    Every volunteer at gets a blue t-shirt at the competition so they can be easily identified.
    They contain the year-specific sponsors so we need to order enough for all the volunteers at the competition.


    We will want to design these with the year-specific sponsors and possibly some game-specific artwork.

    The [base t-shirt design](https://github.com/srobo/promotional-material/blob/main/shirts/Base%20Shirt%20Design.svg) has a non-year specific circuit artwork.
    The font used for the year text is [Audiowide](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Audiowide).
    
    Any text should be converted to paths, the backgrounds removed, and the file saved as a plain svg before ordering.

    The base t-shirt is a Gildan Heavy Cotton t-shirt in Royal Blue.
    For SR2024-25, [clothes2order](https://www.clothes2order.com/products/gildan-heavy-cotton-adult-t-shirt) was used for the t-shirts.
