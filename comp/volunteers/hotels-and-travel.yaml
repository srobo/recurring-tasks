milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
    It's important that volunteers are able to get to the competition,
    therefore hotels and other travel arrangements need to be organised.


    This should also include travel between the venue and the hotels on
    each of the competition days.


    We should also figure out reimbursment arrangements for those who
    have organised their own travel and accomodation.


    Required actions:
     - [ ] Collect which volunteers need accomodation
     - [ ] Organise accomodation
     - [ ] Plan out travel and accomodation reimbursments
