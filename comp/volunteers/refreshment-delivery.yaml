summary: Ensure we can get refreshments to static volunteers

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: volunteer-coordination

description: >-
    Many volunteers are in a single place and cannot move because
    they are continuously active for a long duration (marshall, judges).

    We need a volunteer to take these refreshments to these stationary posts,
    especially those who are permanently in a single role and cannot get
    refreshments for themselves.
