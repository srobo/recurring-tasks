    While helpdesk is the primary point of call for teams who need help,
    we also need a way for those manning it to escalate their request
    if they don't know how to resolve something. This is not intended to
    remove the need to replace broken kit, but rather to provide extended
    support for non-replaceable parts (e.g: complex vision system or
    rules questions).

    We should create a list of subject matter experts and put it on
    helpdesk. Clearly the people on the list need to be actually available
    to help (i.e: both at the venue and not insanely busy), and aware
    that they're the point-of-contact for certain areas.
