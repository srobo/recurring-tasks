area-owner: volunteer-coordination

description: >-
  We need to publicise the date and location of the competition to all
  volunteers and solicit their help, both in preparing for the
  competition and at the competition itself.

  We should prepare a signup form which captures information about the
  volunteer so that we can schedule them at the competition as well as
  provide them with travel and accommodation.

  We should also reach out to the volunteers who have helped in the
  past, as well as those who have expressed an interest in helping in
  the future.

  Required actions:
   - [ ] Create a sign-up form
   - [ ] Send an email to all volunteers encouraging them to signup
