summary: Recruit volunteers for the competition

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: volunteer-coordination

description: >-
  We need to publicise the date and location of the competition to all
  volunteers and solicit their help, both in preparing for the
  competition and at the competition itself.

  We should prepare a signup form which captures information about the
  volunteer so that we can schedule them at the competition as well as
  provide them with travel and accomodation.
