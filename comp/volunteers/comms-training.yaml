summary: Brief volunteers on communications at the $SRYYYY Competition

priority: minor

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: volunteer-coordination

description: >-
  All volunteers will need to have a basic understanding of what communications
  mechanisms we're using and who to contact in various scenarios.

  If we're using radios, then volunteers at stations with radios need to be
  briefed on basic radio protocol, so that they are confident in using it.

  The radio briefing should include:

   * How to start a call (e.g. "Helpdesk, helpdesk, this is reception, reception.")
   * The difference between "Over" and "Out"
