  ## Prepare and send out volunteer information pack

  We should email all the volunteers with information about where to go
  on the day, parking, who to contact, and any other info we need to
  tell them.

  We should aim to send this out at least a few weeks before the competition.

  Some info to potentially include:

    - [ ] Information on third party activities which might complicate travel
          or venue access (e.g: other events, rail works, etc.)
    - [ ] Reminder about the safeguarding policy
    - [ ] Parking locations
    - [ ] Information on arrival times
    - [ ] What to do when you arrive
    - [ ] Roles information
    - [ ] Information on provided lunches (if any)
    - [ ] Information on the volunteer meal
    - [ ] Accommodation reimbursement

  ## Brief Volunteers on Competition Event

  The volunteers need to know:

    - Safeguarding
    - Venue layout (if applicable)
    - Schedule of Event

  ## Brief volunteers on communications at the $SRYYYY Competition

  All volunteers will need to have a basic understanding of what communications
  mechanisms we're using and who to contact in various scenarios.

  If we're using radios, then volunteers at stations with radios need to be
  briefed on basic radio protocol, so that they are confident in using it.

  The radio briefing should include:

   * How to start a call (e.g. "Helpdesk, for reception.")
   * The difference between "Over" and "Out"
