  Since volunteers often don't have time to go out for lunch we should organise
  communal food for lunch during the competition.

  We should have some refreshments for the volunteers at the competition.
  Generally this should include at least tea, coffee & water as well as some biscuits & fruit.
  At a minimum this will include water and cups being available at all times
  throughout the competition including the setup day.
