summary: Plan reimbursement of volunteers

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  After the competition we will need to reimburse volunteers for various
  things. We need to plan (and annouce) what things are eligible for
  reimbursement.

  Typically the hotel stays are covered directly by SR, though we should
  also consider what/how much travel we can reimburse.
