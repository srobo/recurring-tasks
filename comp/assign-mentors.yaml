  We need to assign mentors to teams. This is a good way to ensure that
  teams get the help they need.


  We should assign mentors to teams as early as possible. This will
  allow mentors to get to know their teams and help them prepare for
  the competition.


  Required actions:
   * [ ] Inform teams that mentoring is available
   * [ ] Create a list of teams that want mentoring
   * [ ] Get mentors to sign up to mentor teams
   * [ ] Assign mentors to teams
   * [ ] Inform mentors and teams of the assignment
   * [ ] Get feedback from mentors about team progress throughout the year
