    While we should be happy to replace kit at the competition it is also
    useful to be able to quickly diagnose common issues wit the kit, in
    part so that we don't need to replace it.

    We should therefore bring our kit-testing equipment, jigs, etc. to
    the competition, along with instructions on how to use it.

    Ideally this should be kept at Helpdesk.
