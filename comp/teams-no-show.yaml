summary: Define a process for teams which don't turn up to $SRYYYY events

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: teams

description: >-
    While we do confirm with teams ahead of time whether they're going to turn
    up to our events, inevitably some don't turn up or are late arriving.

    We should have a process for reacting to this, both in terms of how we'll
    communicate with the team and how we'll communicate and respond internally.

    This could be that we'll call the supervisor a few times, though defining things like:
     - how we'll know they're absent (e.g: check with reception)
     - how long to wait after the start of the event
     - how much to try to get in contact with the supervisor (if e.g: the call goes to voicemail)
     - what triggers contacting the secondary contact
     - if/when we drop them out of the competition (if applicable to the event)

    This procedure might be the same for all events or might be different by event.

    Required actions:
     - [ ] Define process for Kickstart
     - [ ] Define process for Tech Days
     - [ ] Define process for Competition
