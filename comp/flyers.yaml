summary: Produce handout flyers for the $SRYYYY Competition

priority: should

component: Media

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: media-press

description: >-
  The primary target of these flyers are invited guests (both of SR and of the
  teams), who may not know very much about either Student Robotics or the game
  the robots are competing in.


  These flyers should include:
   - descriptions of both SR and the game
   - a summary of the teams competing (a list of TLAs and names is fine)
   - the overall schedule of the competition weekend
   - sponsors

  Note: much of the content of these flyers does not need to actually be new --
  the website already contains plenty of summaries of SR and the game, which can
  be copied liberally, as well as the day schedule.


  Once the flyers have been produced, they should be printed and given to
  reception to hand out to guests as they arrive.

   - [ ] Produce the flyers
