description: >-
  After the competition we want to have a news article which describes how the
  event went, which teams won, etc.

  The post-competition news article can take some time to write. We should
  write a skeleton one as soon as possible, and just fill in the blanks
  immediately after the competition followed by high-speed review and
  shipping.
