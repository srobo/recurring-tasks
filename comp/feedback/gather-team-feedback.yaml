  Usual things:
    - Demographics
    - Prior experience
    - Did they get the support they needed
    - Are Tech Days useful to them?
    - Do they feel that they have the resources in school now?
      If not, why aren't they coming/what can we do to make them more useful?
      Is more real-competition testing the key factor here?
