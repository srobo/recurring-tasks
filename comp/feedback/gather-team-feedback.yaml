  To improve the competition programme and capture the information required for sponsorships,
  we need to collect feedback from competitors and team leaders.


  We should send this to everyone who was signed up for $SRYYYY.


  The usual things we try to collect are:
   - Demographics
   - Prior experience
   - Did they get the support they needed
   - Are Tech Days useful to them?
   - Do they feel that they have the resources in school now?
     If not, why aren't they coming/what can we do to make them more useful?
     Is more real-competition testing the key factor here?

  We should also coordinate with the Kit team to make sure sufficient information is captured to direct improvements to the kit.


  Example from SR2020: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HE8b1oRF6dHc3wbBUICJV5CsXHv3qR7egcMtud6pfd4/edit?usp=sharing


  We have found that proactively encouraging teams to fill in the form while they are at the event gives a much better response rate.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Create a feedback form for competitors
   - [ ] Create a feedback form for team supervisors
   - [ ] Share feedback forms with Kit team
   - [ ] Send feedback forms to teams
