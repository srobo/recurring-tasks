priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  We need a means to record and store details of an incident or near-
  miss occurring. At bare minimum this needs to store what happened and
  why, and what follow up occurred.

  SR has an incident record book which was purchased for this purpose.
  We should check that it is still suitable & usable and ensure that it
  will be at the competition venue.
