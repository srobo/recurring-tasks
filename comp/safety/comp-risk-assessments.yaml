summary: Update and publish risk assessments for the competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

priority: must

component: Competition

area-owner: health-safety

description: >-
    The risk assessment for the competition needs updating for $SRYYYY and publishing to schools.
    This should consider the risks posed by competitor-made roobts, LiPo batteries and power tools, and how we handle these.
    The runbook has details of what the current battery protocol is, for example:
    https://studentrobotics.org/runbook/competition/team-support/battery-charging/#safety
    See also the notes at https://github.com/srobo/tasks/issues/822#issuecomment-1090656629 and onwards.


    Alongside this we should ensure that our incident response plans are current & applicable to the selected venue; we should update them as needed.


    Futhermore we will need a means to record and store details of any incident or near-miss occurring.
    At bare minimum this needs to store what happened and why, and what follow up occurred.


    SR has an incident record book which was purchased for this purpose.
    We should check that it is still suitable & usable and ensure that it will be at the competition venue.


    Required actions:
     - [ ] Update risk assessment
     - [ ] Update incident response plan
     - [ ] Publish risk assessment
     - [ ] Have an incident log
     - [ ] Ensure the incident log is delivered to the competition
