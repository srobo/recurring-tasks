summary: Safety check the $SRYYYY robots

priority: must

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition Day

area-owner: kit

description: >-
    We need to inspect all the robots to ensure they are safe.


    The inspectors may want a list of the teams' first matches so they can visit them in order.


    For SR2025, this was split into a safety check (to ensure the robot does not pose an immediate safety risk)
    and a regulation check (to ensure the robot met the regulations laid out in the rules).
    Both of these checks were handled at Helpdesk with teams coming to Helpdesk when they were ready to be checked.


    It is also useful for the plan to cover handling teams that arrive late to the venue.


    Required actions:
     - [ ] Prepare the inspection checklist
     - [ ] Inspect the robots
     - [ ] Record the results of the inspection
     - [ ] Re-inspect robots that failed
