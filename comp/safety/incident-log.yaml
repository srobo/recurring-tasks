milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

priority: must

component: Competition

area-owner: health-safety

description: >-
    We will need a means to record and store details of any incident or near-miss occurring.
    At bare minimum this needs to store what happened and why, and what follow up occurred.


    SR has an incident record book which was purchased for this purpose.
    Checking that it is still suitable should have been done in the risk assessment task,
    but we should ensure that it will be at the competition venue.


    Required actions:
     - [ ] Ensure the incident log is delivered to the competition

dependencies:
    - comp/safety/comp-risk-assessments
