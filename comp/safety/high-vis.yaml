summary: Organise high-vis jackets for the teams at the competition

component: Arena

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
    At the competition we use high-vis jackets to signify that a robot
    has passed the safety checks and which member of the team is responsible
    for the robot.

    As only a team member wearing the high-vis jacket may enter the staging
    area, this keeps the number of people in the staging area low while making
    it exceedingly clear who to talk to about each robot.

    We need to ensure that
     - we have enough jackets for all the teams
     - the jackets are marked clearly with the teams' TLAs (both front and back)

    Laminated printouts safety-pinned to the jackets are usually a good way to
    add the TLAs.
