    This task will need to be done for each tech day.

    # from comp/safety/risk-assessments.yaml
    ## Update and publish risk assessments for the competition
    The risk assessment for the competition needs updating for $SRYYYY and publishing to schools.

    # from comp/safety/incident-plan.yaml
    ## Prepare an incident response plan

    We should ensure that our incident response plans are current &
    applicable to the selected venue; we should update them as needed.

    # from comp/safety/incident-record.yaml
    ## Have a means to record an incident

    We need a means to record and store details of an incident or near-
    miss occurring. At bare minimum this needs to store what happened and
    why, and what follow up occurred.

    SR has an incident record book which was purchased for this purpose.
    We should check that it is still suitable & usable and ensure that it
    will be at the competition venue.
