summary: Get stationery for scoring the $SRYYYY Competition

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  Once printed we need something to store the score entry forms in
  (as there will be a couple of hundred sheets).

  We also need folders to store the completed sheets in. Ideally
  these would be lever-arch style with dividers to separate chunks
  of matches. Previously the sheets were grouped into batches of
  four match slots (eight games; 16 sheets) at twenty dividers
  (80 match slots) per folder. This seems a reasonable rate to
  use again.

  Unless they are pre-punched, the score-entry people will want
  a decent hole-punch for punching the entry forms before putting
  them in the folders.

  The linesmen will also want clipboards and pens to use to fill
  out the score sheets. We should have some clipboards (probably
  in Southampton) from previous years.
