summary: Import the final league match schedule

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: game

description: >-
  Many league match schedules should already have been generated with a range of number of teams so they can be easily subsituted in if there are any last minute dropouts.


  We should check if the current schedule is correct at appropriate times just before the competition.
  At these points, if the current schedule has an outdated number of teams, we should import a new schedule.
  This stops the schedule needlessly being updated many times whilst ensuring that it is up-to-date for the competition.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Check/import around a week before the competition
   - [ ] Check/import the morning of the competition

dependencies:
  - comp/game/match-schedule-generate
