summary:  Organise match ops for the $SRYYYY competition

priority: should

component: Arena

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: game

  In order to make sure match ops runs smoothly the processes for marshals
  and shepherds needs to be thought out in advance.

  This includes how many people we need for match ops.
  5 people per match ops team gives shepherding cover for 4 venue areas and the arena for shift lead,
  and arena-side cover of 2 marshals, 2 badgers, and 1 score entry.
  3 teams of match ops ensures that match ops volunteers get adequate breaks.
  We should make sure some extra volunteers are trained on top of this number, so that we have back-ups.

  For arena side match ops, this will include:
   - Marshalling/scoring
   - Score entry
   - Resetting tokens
   - Badgering
   - How robots/competitors enter/exit arena

  This should be as comprehensive as possible in order to simplify the training that these volunteers need.
  And should probably go in the arena repo as it will change considerably
  between years and will be specific to the details of the arena.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Plan how shepherding will work
   - [ ] Plan the training for the different areas of match ops (shepherding, marshal, badger, score entry)
   - [ ] Schedule match ops
