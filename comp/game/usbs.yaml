  During matches the robots need a mechanism to know which corner they're
  in and to ensure that they can only see the proper libkoki markers.

  This is usually solved by using a set of competition-mode USB keys
  which the teams plugged into their robots.

  We need two sets of each key; one for the robot currently playing,
  one for the robot currently preparing. They will be kept in the
  staging-area.

  SR owns several full sets of these (enough for several sets over two arenas),
  though these should be checked to ensure they are still functional and have
  the correct data on them.
