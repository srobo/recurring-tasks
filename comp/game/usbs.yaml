summary: Prepare competition-mode USB keys

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: game

description: >-
  During matches the robots need a mechanism to know which corner they're
  in.

  This is currently solved by using a set of competition-mode USB keys
  which the teams plugged into their robots. These light up with the corner
  colour that they are assigned to.

  We need two sets of each key; one for the robot currently playing,
  one for the robot currently preparing. They will be kept in the
  staging-area.

  SR owns 12 of these, the match data on them may need updating for match timeout.

  Required actions:
   - [ ] Update match data on comp-mode USBs

dependencies:
  - comp/game/match-ops
