  During matches the robots need a mechanism to know which corner they're
  in.

  This is usually solved by using a set of competition-mode USB keys
  which the teams plugged into their robots.

  We need two sets of each key; one for the robot currently playing,
  one for the robot currently preparing. They will be kept in the
  staging-area.

  SR owns 12 of these, though these should be checked to ensure
  they are still functional and have the correct data on them.
