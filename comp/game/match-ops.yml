  ## Organise shepherding

  The situation for shepherding teams to their matches needs to be
  organised.

  # from comp/arena/reset-checklist.yaml
  ## Make an arena reset checklist

  We should create a checklist for the marshals so they know what needs
  to be done between matches to reset the arena. This should be as
  comprehensive as possible in order to simplify the training that these
  volunteers need.

  This should probbaly go in the arena repo as it will change considerably
  between years and will be specific to the details of the arena.

  See https://github.com/srobo/arena/blob/master/comp19/reset-checklist.md for
  an example.
