description: >-
  In order to run matches a schedule for the league matches needs to be generated.
  The final version of this may need generating close to the day,
  once we have a firmer number for attending teams.


  Then we need to decide on the structure of the knockouts.
  Generally this has been a single elimination tournament.
  With the top of the leaderboard starting at later rounds when the number of teams is not a power of 2.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Generate an initial match schedule
   - [ ] Decide on the knockout shape
   - [ ] Generate the final match schedule

dependencies:
  - comp/day-schedule
