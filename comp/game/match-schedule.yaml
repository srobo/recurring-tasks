  In order to run matches, a schedule for the league matches needs to be generated.
  Ideally, many schedules should be generated with a range of number of teams so they can be easily subsituted in if there are any last minute dropouts.


  Then we need to decide on the structure of the knockouts.
  Generally this has been a single elimination tournament, however SR2025 was a double elimination tournament.
  Similarly to the league schedules, we should have a range of brackets we can use based on the number of teams we end up having for the Knockouts.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Decide on the number of appearances for each possible total number of teams
   - [ ] Generate league match schedules based on these number of appearances
   - [ ] Create knockout brackets for a range of total number of teams
   - [ ] Convert the brackets into suitable format for import into the competition software
