summary: Organise how arena testing slots will be booked

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition Prep

area-owner: game

description: >-
  There is limited availablity for teams to test their robots in the arenas.
  We need to plan how we are going to ensure that this time is fairly distributed between teams.

  Tinker time slots in the main arena need to be long enough for teams to properly run through their strategies in the actual arena.
  Conversely, test arena slots need to be regular enough that teams aren't waiting significant times to be able to test.

  Required actions:
   - [ ] Decide on the lengths of tinker time and test arena slots
   - [ ] Decide how tinker time slots are booked
   - [ ] Decide how test arena slots are booked
   - [ ] Decide where teams book their slots

dependencies:
  - comp/day-schedule
