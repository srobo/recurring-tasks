summary: Prepare game equipment for the arena

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: event-logistics

description: >-
    We need to prepare the things that will go in the arena, including the
    wall markers, the robot flags, any tokens and other props.
    See this year's [rulebook](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/resources/$YYYY/rulebook.pdf)
    for details.


    During matches robots are given coloured flags so that the audience know which
    robot is from which scoring zone. At least two complete sets of each badge are needed:
    one for the robots currently playing and another for the robots currently staging.


    The markers should be printed as part of the main printing run.


    We may also need tools for the arena construction. Generally we'll need
    some drills, screwdrivers and a tape measure. We may also need a knife
    to cut the carpet.

     - [ ] Prepare the wall markers
     - [ ] Prepare the robot flags
     - [ ] Prepare the tokens
     - [ ] Prepare the other props
     - [ ] Organise tools needed for assembly
