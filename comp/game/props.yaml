summary: Prepare game equipment for the arena

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
    We need to prepare the things that will go in the arena.
    See this year's [rulebook](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/resources/$YYYY/rulebook.pdf)
    for details.

    Sub tasks should be added to this task for each of the various props which
    are needed.

    # from comp/game/markers.yaml
    ## Organise markers for the arena

    The arena (and, possibly, things inside it) is marked with AprilTag
    markers, which need printing off in advance.

    Additionally, if we have multiple arenas, we need a label for each
    arena to distinguish them (i.e. A and B).

    # from comp/game/robot-flags.yaml
    ## Prepare robot flags for the competition

    During matches robots are given coloured flags so that the audience know which
    robot is from which scoring zone.

    At least two complete sets of each badge are needed: one for the robots
    currently playing and another for the robots currently staging.

    # from comp/arena/tools.yaml
    ## Organise tools for arena construction

    For arena construction we'll likely need various tools. Many of these we
    probably have, however we should put together a list of what we think we'll
    need and then ensure that we'll actually have it available.

    This includes things like hand & power tools for the arena itself as well as
    knives and measures for the carpet.
