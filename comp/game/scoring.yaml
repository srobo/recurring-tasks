  ## Create $SRYYYY game score format

  The format for the game data YAML files which record match outcomes
  needs to be designed.

  There is guidance for how to do this for SRComp at
  https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/srcomp/wiki/Competition-Preparation#configure-game-scoring

  # from comp/game/score-forms.yaml
  ## Design score entry forms for marshals

  Score entry forms for use by marshals in the arenas need to be
  designed.

  There is guidance for how to do this for SRComp at
  https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/srcomp/wiki/Competition-Preparation#create-a-score-sheet

  # from comp/game/score-forms-print.yaml
  ## Print score entry forms for marshals

  The actual sheets to be filled in need to be printed.

  # from comp/game/score-entry.yaml
  ## Create score data entry system (update the scorer UI)

  We need a data entry system for converting from the score entry forms
  to the YAML file format.

  This task is both the root for preparing this system and covers the updating
  of the scorer UI for this year's game.

  See https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/srcomp/wiki/Competition-Preparation#update-srcomp-scorer
  for details of the latter.

  # from comp/game/scoring-stationery.yaml
  ## Get stationery for scoring the $SRYYYY Competition

  Once printed we need something to store the score entry forms in
  (as there will be a couple of hundred sheets).

  We also need folders to store the completed sheets in. Ideally
  these would be lever-arch style with dividers to separate chunks
  of matches. Previously the sheets were grouped into batches of
  four match slots (eight games; 16 sheets) at twenty dividers
  (80 match slots) per folder. This seems a reasonable rate to
  use again.

  Unless they are pre-punched, the score-entry people will want
  a decent hole-punch for punching the entry forms before putting
  them in the folders.

  The marshals will also want clipboards and pens to use to fill
  out the score sheets. We should have some clipboards in storage
  from previous years.

  # from comp/ops/scoring-entry-hardware.yaml
  ## Organise machine to run score entry

  This ticket relates to providing the actual machine that will be
  used by the score entry volunteers.

  This needs to be a machine capable of running the score-entry software
  locally, so probably running a linux, and will need access to the
  competition network.

  Included in this is provision for a screen, keyboard & mouse. If the machine
  is a laptop then that simplifies this greatly, though an external mouse
  should still be provided.

  # from comp/game/desk-lamp.yaml
  ## Get desk lamp for score entry

  Having a desk lamp on the score-entry desk can be useful if it is
  located somewhere that may not have enough light otherwise. This is
  particularly the case in the Cube at Southampton, though is likely
  less of an issue in other venues.
