    To allow teams to watch the competition matches remotely, such as from their pits,
    we should to livestream the event.


    To do this we need a machine to run the livestream, and a plan for how the
    livestream will be run. This will also need to include where cameras are placed
    around the arena.


    In previous years, we have borrowed or hired equipment to run the livestream,
    the general requirements are:
     * Video mixer PC (With dedicated GPU, capable of running OBS)
     * 2× HDMI capture card
     * 2× preview monitors
     * 2× cameras (depending on feed plan)
     * Audio mixers

    Ideas for the camera feeds:
     * Arena (likely multiple)
       * Top down view showing whole arena
       * Side view showing one side of the arena
       * A PTZ camera to follow the action
     * Hosts (who may be different to commentators)
     * Stage (only needed for prize giving)

    Scenes will also need to be created in OBS in advance of the competition.
