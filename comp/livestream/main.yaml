description: >-
  We should have a live stream of the competition.

  We'll need to work out:
   - what hardware & sofware will be used to drive the stream (both cameras and
   mixing desk/driver computer)
   - where the cameras for the stream should go

dependencies:
  - comp/venue/network
  - comp/livestream/training
  - comp/livestream/hardware
  - comp/livestream/configure-scenes
