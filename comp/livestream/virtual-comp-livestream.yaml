    As the virtual competition is presented as a livestream, we need to
    prepare how it will be run. This is likely to be similar to the livestream
    for Kickstart, but with some differences.


    To do this we need a machine to run the livestream, and a plan for how the
    livestream will be run. Additionally, we need to decide who will present
    the livestream.


    In the past, this livestream has had both presenters and producers in a single
    location, and used the producer's machine to run the livestream. However, this
    can be done remotely, so we may want to consider this.


    In terms of scenes and feeds, the livestream generally consists of:
     - An introduction, to explain the game and the competition
     - An in match view, where the match recording is played
     - A post match view, normally with the presenters' camera feeds
     - A view of the league table
     - A view of the schedule
     - Optionally, some playbacks of interesting moments from the matches
