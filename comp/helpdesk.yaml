  ## Plan helpdesk at the competition

  Helpdesk is the single-point-of-contact for teams to get help with
  their robots. We need to plan who will run this on the day as well
  as the various things it needs to be able to help the teams.

  # from comp/pits/helpdesk/expert-list.yaml
  ## Create domain expert list

  If there is a problem at helpdesk, that those on helpdesk cannot solve, they need to know who to escalate to.

  There will be different experts depending on the domain.

  Example domains:

    * Rules
    * Kit
        * Python API
        * Hardware
        * Competition operations
    * Event
        * Tech

  Note that this list of people should also take into account who is likely to be available.

  # from comp/volunteers/experts-list.yaml
  ## Create a list of available subject matter experts

  While helpdesk is the primary point of call for teams who need help,
  we also need a way for those manning it to escalate their request
  if they don't know how to resolve something. This is not intended to
  remove the need to replace broken kit, but rather to provide extended
  support for non-replaceable parts (e.g: complex vision system or
  rules questions).

  We should create a list of subject matter experts and put it on
  helpdesk. Clearly the people on the list need to be actually available
  to help (i.e: both at the venue and not insanely busy), and aware
  that they're the point-of-contact for certain areas.

  # from comp/pits/helpdesk/spare-kit.yaml
  ## Have spare kit available at the competition

  If kit breaks at the competition for teams, we should be prepared to
  replace it quickly. For that we will need spares readily available.

  Ideally this kit should be kept at Helpdesk. Helpdesk should at least be
  informed of the policy for replacing kit.
