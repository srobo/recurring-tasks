description: >-
    In addition to the task-specific social media related to the competition
    announcement and the news article afterwards we should ensure that our
    social media accounts make a lot of noise about the competition.

    In the lead-up to the competition this means we should be inviting
    people to attend.

    During the competition we should consider including some summary
    commentary about how the teams are doing, as well as interacting
    with the accounts for the teams. We should also announce the results
    as they become available (i.e: during the prize-giving ceremony).

    Required actions:
     - [ ] Advertise the competition on social media
     - [ ] Live-tweet (or equivalent) the competition
     - [ ] Announce the results of the competition on social media
