  ## Get photos of Teams and Robots at the competition

  Photos make for good publicity material and allow teams to show off
  their dress and their robot.

  # from comp/photos/blueshirts.yaml
  ## Take a group photo of the Blueshirts

  We should take a group photograph of all the Blueshrits.

  # from comp/photos/everyone.yaml
  ## Take a group photo of everyone

  We should take a group photograph of all the teams and their robots.

  We've managed this at a couple of previous competitions and generally
  the photos are useful for advertising ourselves in the future.
  They also serve as a useful tool when looking back to identify which
  robots appeared in which years.

  # from comp/photos/teams.yaml
  ## Take photos of all the teams and their robots

  We should take photographs individually of all the teams and their
  robots. This allows them to show off their team image as well as
  their robot while both providing us with marketing media and the
  teams with a nice photo of their whole group.
