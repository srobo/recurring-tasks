summary: Kit handback arrangement

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: kit

description: >-
  After the competition has finished, we need teams to return their kits to us before
  they leave the venue.

  Since teams will be wanting to leave the venue promptly, we need to make sure that the
  kit handback process is as quick and painless as possible. However, we also need to
  keep track of which kits have been returned to us, and what items are missing from
  each kit.

  Required actions:
   - [ ] Plan where the kit handback will take place
   - [ ] Plan how to record what items each team has returned
   - [ ] Organise how many people will be needed to run the kit handback

dependencies:
