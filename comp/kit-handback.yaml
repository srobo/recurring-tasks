  ## Plan how we will do extended kit loans to teams

  We often let teams keep kit after the competition we should plan if
  and how we are going to do this.

  Historically we have set a deadline of about a month in advance of the
  competition for teams to apply for a loan. For the agreed loans, those teams
  can then bypass kit-return at the competition by showing their authorisation.
