  # from comp/tear-down/main.yaml
  ## Tear down everything after the competition

  Everything will need tearing down at the end of the competition.

  # from comp/tear-down/destinations.yaml
  ## Create a list of return destinations for everything

  We need a plan of what is going to be returned to where after the
  competition, ideally with in-venue holding areas identified for each
  return destination.

  As the sources of items are not in general known (and so cannot be
  included here directly), sub-tasks for each destination should be
  added to this task each year.

  # from comp/venue/transport/return.yaml
  ## Return stuff from the competition to storage

  Equipment that came from storage for the competition needs to return
  there after the competition.
