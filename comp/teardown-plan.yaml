summary: Plan competition teardown

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition Prep

area-owner: event-logistics

description: >-
  In general, the process of tearing down the competition is the reverse
  of setting it up.


  This will consist of disposing of used consumables, returning borrowed
  and hired equipment, and returning SR equipment to storage.


  We should make sure, during setup, that borrowed items are clearly
  marked as such so that they can be easily identified during teardown.


  The SR2025 plan generally followed:
   - Volunteers at the end of the competition should pack up their own area.
   - SUSU hires should be left where they are.
   - Once most areas are packed, the equipment should be moved to clubs & socs.
   - A person will be appointed to coordinate where items are stacked in clubs & socs and what is going into which box.
   - A person should count the remaining quantities of everything marked as consumable in the logistics sheet.
   - People should then assist SUSU in tidying and resetting the venue.

  Required actions:
   - [ ] Dispose of consumables
   - [ ] Plan returning of borrowed items
   - [ ] Plan returning of hired items
   - [ ] Plan how SR equipment will be organised in to boxes for storage
