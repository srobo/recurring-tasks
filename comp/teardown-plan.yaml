priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition Prep

area-owner: event-logistics

description: >-
  In general, the process of tearing down the competition is the reverse
  of setting it up.


  This will consist of disposing of used consumables, returning borrowed
  and hired equipment, and returning SR equipment to storage.


  We should make sure, during setup, that borrowed items are clearly
  marked as such so that they can be easily identified during teardown.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Dispose of consumables
   - [ ] Plan returning of borrowed items
   - [ ] Plan returning of hired items
   - [ ] Plan how SR equipment will be organised in to boxes for storage
