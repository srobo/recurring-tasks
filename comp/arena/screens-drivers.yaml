summary: Organise drivers for the arena screens

priority: should

component: Arena

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: game

description: |
    We have screens around the arena to display live information, these
    need something to drive them.

    In the past this has been Raspberry Pis displaying a web-page. If
    this is used again then the following things need doing:
     * Ensure we have enough Pis that work
     * Ensure we have enough Pi power supplies that work
     * Pre-load the Pis SD cards with the proper OS
     * Label each Pi with where it will be deployed (e.g: Arena B, Corner 1)
     * Ensure the Pis will have a suitable name/address on the network
