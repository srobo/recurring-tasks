summary: Have a supply of charged batteries by the $SRYYYY Arenas

priority: major

component: Arena

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  We should have a supply of charged batteries in the staging area next to the
  arena so that teams on their way into matches don't need to go to helpdesk to
  get one. This ensures that robots perform at their best during matches.

  This is important during the knockouts, though less so during the leagues.
