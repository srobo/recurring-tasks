summary: Put crowd barriers around the arenas

component: Arena

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: event-logistics

description: >-
    Since SR2015 we have used short wood-only walls for the actual arenas
    and had separate crowd barriers around the arena area (including the
    staging area).

    We need to ensure that these barriers are procured in advance and then
    put into place before the first matches.

    Since SR2022 we have used rope barriers instead of crowd barriers.
