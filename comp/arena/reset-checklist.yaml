summary:  Make an arena reset checklist

priority: major

component: Arena

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  We should create a checklist for the marshalls so they know what needs
  to ebe done between matches to reset the arena. This should be as
  comprehensive as possible in order to simplify the training that these
  volunteers need.

  This should probbaly go in the arena repo as it will change considerably
  between years and will be specific to the details of the arena.

  See https://github.com/srobo/arena/blob/master/comp19/reset-checklist.md for
  an example.
