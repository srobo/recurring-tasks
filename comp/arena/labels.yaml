    Since we have more than one arena we want a way to tell which is
    which. One possible mechanism is to colour-code them, though having
    printed name labels is easy and has been done in the past.

    There are some handy large A and B label PDFs attached to #2964.

    Note that since people need to use the label of the arena to clearly
    communicate which they're talking about it is best to stick to having
    a single name for each.
