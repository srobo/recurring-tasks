description: >-
  Throughout the venue we typically have a number of general information screens
  which show the schedule of matches, state of the league, etc. We need to organise
  screens & drivers for these to run on. They also need power and internet connections.

  This may also include stands to mount the screens on. These screens are typically
  larger-format than the screens used within the arena.
