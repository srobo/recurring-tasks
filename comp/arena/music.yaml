milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
    During matches we want music to be played into the arena.

    We typically have 2 playlists: one for during matches, and one for during breaks.
    Generally the former is more "intense" than the latter.

    Note that there is a separate task for the time-synchronised music played
    during the finals.

    - comp/venue/sound
