    During matches we want music to be played into the arena.

    We typically have 2 playlists: one for during matches, and one for during breaks.
    Generally the former is more "intense" than the latter.

    Note that there is a separate task for the time-synchronised music played
    during the finals.

    ## Prepare the finals music for the compettion

    We generally use a bespoke cut of various songs for the finals tracks, to
    build tension, ensure the music is dramatic enough, and is timed perfectly,
    with starting of matches and timing.

    Note that there is a separate task for the music played during the rest of
    the matches.
