summary: Plan a retro for the $SRYYYY competition

priority: must

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: volunteer-coordination

description: >-
  We want to have a retro soon after the competition, so that we can capture
  and evaluate feedback whilst its fresh. We should plan how we want to collect
  feedback, and how we want to run the retro.

  Ideally, feedback collection will be available prior to the setup, so that
  points can be raised as they occur.

  Required actions:
    - [ ] Decide how we want to collect feedback
    - [ ] Decide how we want to run the retro
    - [ ] Make feedback collection available; ideally before the competition
