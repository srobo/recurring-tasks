description: >-
    During week preceding and particularly over the competition weekend our
    competitor-services server gets a lot more load than it normally does.
    The easiest way to ensure that it can cope is to temporarily uprate its
    capacity with the hosting provider over the competition period.

    In the past we've gone up part-way on the weekend before and then
    up again for the competition weekend itself.
