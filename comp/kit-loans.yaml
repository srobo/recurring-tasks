summary:  Plan how we will do extended kit loans to teams

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  We often let teams keep kit after the competition we should plan if
  and how we are going to do this.

  Historically we have set a deadline of about a month in advance of the
  competition for teams to apply for a loan. For the agreed lonas, those teams
  can then bypass kit-return at the compettion by showing their authorisation.
