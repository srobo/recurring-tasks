  We need a list of items which should be collected from storage.

  This should be in a format which can easily be used at the storage location.
  Thus it should:

   - be easily available offline
   - be arranged around the items to collect (rather than e.g: where they should go)
   - describe the important properties of those items (e.g: distinguish desk mount vs scaff mount monitors)
   - (where possible) be grouped into units which match how things are arranged in storage
     - no duplication of similar items (use quantities instead)
     - indicate boxes to grab where items are known to be grouped together (e.g: "box of arena Pis: sr1A2B"),
       but do clarify the expected contents (e.g: "1× Pi 3B, 4× Pi 1B")
