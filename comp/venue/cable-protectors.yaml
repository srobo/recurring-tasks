description: >-
    It's a bad idea to have loose cables trailing around on the floor.
    We should hire cable protectors to cover the cables anywhere necessary.

    Note when ordering them: it turns out to be easier to setup shorter
    runs than longer ones. As a result where runs pass under tables (etc.)
    we should get several short pieces rather than single long ones.
