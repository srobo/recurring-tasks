  # from comp/venue/network.yaml
  ## Have a competition network

    This also requires that we have a pretty significant internet connection
    given the number of people that are coming and our video streaming
    requirement.

    If possible this should be mostly configured in a corner of the venue
    as early as possible during setup and then, once working, deployed
    to the proper locations.

    # from comp/venue/pits/network.yaml
    ## Organise internet access for the team pits

    Teams need access to the internet to access Discord and the documentation.
    We therefore need network access in all the team pits.

    Past experience with WiFi-only network provision has been mixed, so hard-wire
    network provision should be considered unless the venue has well proven
    capacity.

    Some venues' internet provision requires the use of guest accounts. If these
    are needed, We should ensure (as part of this task or by adding a sub-task)
    that suitable accounts are obtained, ideally at least per-team as well as for
    volunteers.
