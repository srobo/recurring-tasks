priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: event-logistics

description: >-
  Internet access is required for several aspects of the competition.
   - Allowing teams to access the documentation and Discord
   - Allowing the livestream to be broadcast to YouTube
   - Allowing publishing of scores to the website

  For much of the production network, we use a wired network, connected to
  the venue's internet connection. For the team pits, we use a WiFi network
  that, for the last few years, has been provided by the venue (Eduroam).


  Some venues' internet provision requires the use of guest accounts. If these
  are needed, We should ensure that suitable accounts are obtained,
  ideally at least per-team as well as for volunteers.


  Required Actions:
   - [ ] Ensure that the venue's wired network connection is available
   - [ ] Acquire guest accounts for the guest WiFi network, if needed

dependencies:
  - comp/venue/layout
