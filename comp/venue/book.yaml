    We need a venue for $SRYYYY.

    # from comp/venue/ppl-prs.yaml
    ## Get PRS/PPL: TheMusicLicense for the competition

    In order to play music at the competition we need a "TheMusicLicence"
    (which replaced the separate PRS & PPL licenses in 2018).

    See https://pplprs.co.uk/ for details.

    Note that some venues may have their own licenses and that we may be
    covered by their license.

    # from comp/arena/carpet.yaml
    ## Acquire carpet for the $SRYYYY arenas

    We currently use carpet as the flooring of the arenas. Usually the
    venue doesn't have an equivalent flooring underneath the arena
    area so we need to get some ourselves.

    We need enough for all the arenas plus some spare for a testing area.

    # from comp/arena/screens-stands.yaml
    ## Organise stands for the arena screens

    The arena screens need to be mounted on something to be visible.

    # from comp/venue/sound.yaml
    ## Sort out sound system for the competition

    Speakers and wireless microphones for the judges are required.

    # from comp/venue/arena-lighting.yaml
    ## Organise arena lighting

    We need lighting on the arenas.

    # from comp/venue/radios.yaml
    ## Hire radios for the competition

    We need to hire some radios and headsets.

    # from comp/venue/tables.yaml
    ## Organise tables and chairs for the competition

    We're not sure how many chairs and tables will make a pit yet.
    This will change based on venue.

    For several years we have used 2-4 chairs and 1 table per team.
