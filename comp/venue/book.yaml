    We need a venue for $SRYYYY.


    This needs to have enough space for the arenas, team pits, reception,
    helpdesk, and so forth.


    The equipment we also hire includes:
     - Carpet to floor the arenas, allow 1m outside all sides [^1]
     - Barriers to surround the main arena [^2]
     - 1 table and 2-4 chairs per team
     - Power distribution, 2 sockets per team
     - ~15 tables for the reception, helpdesk, staging, etc.
     - Some chairs for volunteers
     - A sound system throughout the venue
       - With independent feeds for the arena and pits
     - 2x wireless microphones for commentary
     - General lighting for the arena
     - Stands for the arena corner screens
     - 10-12 handheld radios
     - Additional displays for the pit area (potentially with stands)

    [^1]: In venues with carpetted floors you may be able to for go the additional carpet.

    [^2]: Since SR2015 the arena has been constructed of ~12" high wall segments so an
    additional barrier is need to separate the arena from the spectators.
    This was originally metal crowd barriers, since SR2022 we have used rope barriers instead.
    These have worked better at staying in position.

    You may also want to consider:
     - A backdrop for the photo studio
     - Coloured floor lighting around the arena
     - Theatrical lasers for the arena

    In order to play licensed music at the competition we need a "TheMusicLicence".
    Some venues may already have this so it's worth enquiring.


    Note: This does not cover using licensed music on the livestream.


    Required actions:
     - [ ] Book a venue
     - [ ] Hire other necessary equipment
     - [ ] Confirm the venue has a music license
