  This will need to specify where the arenas, team pits, reception,
  helpdesk and so forth are.

  The outcome from this task should be an entry in https://github.com/srobo/comp-floorplans.

  ## Plan the Tech Desk

  Ensure we have enough table top space, power and networking for all necessary equipment at the tech desk.

  For the past few years, the tech desk has been inside the venue's tech booth and contained:
    - Networking
    - Radio charging
    - Lighting desk
    - Sound desk
    - Computers for:
      - compbox
      - Non-sync audio (background music not running through mixtape)
     - sync audio (currently [mixtape](https://github.com/srobo/srcomp-mixtape))

  The livestream have had a pair of tables near the arena, but far enough away to not be too loud.

  A separate 1-2 tables near the arena and staging have contained:
   - Event scoring control + printing
   - Judging
   - Score-entry

  ## Work out layout of teams at the competition

  The layout of team pits in the venue needs to be worked out. There are
  constraints such as keeping teams under the same teacher close
  together, and keeping overseas teams near each other.

  This task covers both the placement of the pits within the venue and the
  allocation of specific teams to pits.

  Ideally the pits should be internally numbered and kept with an ordered list
  of teams which fit to those locations. This helps ensure that the compstate
  can easily be kept in step with the physical locations of each team.

  # from comp/reception/main.yaml
  ## Arrange a reception desk at the competition

  In SR2023 this consisted of four individual desks arranged such that
  one was on each side of two lanes. Each lane had its own queue and
  rope barrier was used to divide them. At the desk, teams signed in
  and handed over their batteries and chargers. They were then
  directed to their pit area.

  A small number of additional volunteers were also placed around the
  desks to direct people towards their proper pit area.

  # from comp/pits/battery-charging.yaml
  ## Prepare battery charging station

  There are many batteries that need charging and we need to set up the
  charging station. This should be somewhere safe to charge the batteries
  and with reasonable access to helpdesk (as that is where teams will get
  batteries from).

  Note: the battery charging station should reconfigure the chargers to
  a higher current than we allow the teams to use as this substantially
  reduces the charge time. Instructions on how to do this should be made
  available to those running the charging station.
