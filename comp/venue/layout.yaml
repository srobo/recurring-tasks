  So that we can plan the competition, we need to know what the layout of the
  venue will be.

  The outcome from this task should be an entry in https://github.com/srobo/comp-floorplans.

  This should include:
   * The arena (or arenas)
   * The team pits
   * The reception
   * The helpdesk(s)
   * The power tools area
   * The battery charging area (near the helpdesk)
   * The staging area
   * The photo booth
   * The test arena
   * First aid
   * The tech desk
   * The livestream
   * Score entry

  Each team pit should be numbered and have a list of teams assigned to them.
  They are normally 2.5x2.5m, but this may vary.

  As well as the overall layout, there are certain locations which need
  specific consideration: the tech desk, score entry, and the livestream.

  For the past few years, the tech desk has been inside the venue's tech booth and contained:
   - Networking
   - Radio charging
   - Lighting desk
   - Sound desk
   - Computers for:
     - compbox
     - Non-sync audio (background music not running through mixtape)
   - sync audio (currently [mixtape](https://github.com/srobo/srcomp-mixtape))

  The livestream have had a pair of tables near the arena, but far enough away to not be too loud.

  A separate 1-2 tables near the arena and staging have contained:
   - Event scoring control + printing
   - Judging
   - Score-entry

  Reception has been a pair of tables near the entrance to the venue.
  These are scaled up for the initial rush of teams arriving.

  When teams arrive, they are directed to the reception desk where they sign in and hand over their batteries and chargers.
  They are then given any swag, booklets and directed to their pit area.

  When laying out the staging area, it needs tables for the robots to be placed on before and after for their match.

   - [ ] Decide on the layout of the venue
   - [ ] Organise the tech desk
   - [ ] Update the floorplan repo with the layout
