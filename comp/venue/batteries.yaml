  ## Have a supply of charged batteries by the $SRYYYY Arenas

  We should have a supply of charged batteries in the staging area next to the
  arena so that teams on their way into matches don't need to go to helpdesk to
  get one. This ensures that robots perform at their best during matches.

  This is important during the knockouts, though less so during the leagues.

  ## Plan overnight kit & battery loans at the competition

  Many teams will want to take their kits home with them overnight at
  the competition, in order to work on them. We usually require these
  teams to fill in some paperwork to record this, in order to ensure we
  know which team have done this and which parts they have taken with
  them. The latter is important as they will likely not be taking with
  them the same batteries as they had for the rest of the year and so
  the inventory will not track this loan.

  See https://srobo.github.io/runbook/competition/teams/process-docs/overnight-battery-loan/
  for details.

  # from comp/safety/sad-battery-management.yaml
  ## Plan for handling of sad batteries

  We should have a plan for how to handle lipos which are deemed to be unusable.
  This is to cover the handling of the lipos at the event, not the disposal
  afterwards.

  See the runbook for the current safety protocol:
