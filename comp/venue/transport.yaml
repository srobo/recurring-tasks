priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: event-logistics

description: >-
  A large quantity of equipment needs to be transported to and from the
  competition venue. For the setup includes things like the arena, and spare kit,
  and for the teardown this will also include all the teams kits.

  Generally, it is most cost effective to hire one van to transport transport
  items from storage to the competition venue on the Thursday and then hire a second
  van to return items to storage on the Monday.

  For both vans, we will need someone with a full UK driving license of suitable
  age, who is available, to drive the van.

  Required actions:
   - [ ] Decide on the size of the van required
   - [ ] Decide when the equipment will be transported to the venue
   - [ ] Organise a driver for the van for the Thursday/Wednesday
   - [ ] Organise a driver for the van for the Monday
   - [ ] Book the vans
