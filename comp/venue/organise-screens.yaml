summary: Organise display screens for the $SRYYYY competition

priority: should

component: Arena

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: event-logistics

description: >-
  SR owns 6 matching screens, without stands, which are used for the
  arena displays. These have the required cables to plug into HDMI sources.


  We also have some 19" screens with stands and a variety of other input types.


  We need to figure out what screens we need for the competition and
  whether we have enough of the right type.


  For the past few years we have used:
   - 5 screens at the arena (4 corners & staging).
   - 2/3 screens for the livestream.
   - 1 screen for scoring entry and comp ops.
   - Installed screens at the venue presenting at least 1 outside screen and 1 livestream per area of the venue.

  For each screen we will need something to drive it.
  For the livestream and scoring entry screens these are often laptops that people provide, so have an inbuilt display.
  For the arena screens we have used Raspberry Pis in the past.
  These will need to be set up to display a web-page (either the compbox or the livestream) and cabling will need to be arranged.
