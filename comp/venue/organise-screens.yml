  ## Acquire screens

  We do not have enough screens to cover everything, so we may need to hire
  more.

  4 screens per arena, plus 2 for staging / shepherding.

  Plus however many needed for non arena screens ("outside").

  # from comp/arena/non-arena-display-screens.yaml
  ## Organise the non-arena ("outside") display screens

  Throughout the venue we typically have a number of general information screens
  which show the schedule of matches, state of the league, etc. We need to organise
  screens & drivers for these to run on. They also need power and internet connections.

  This may also include stands to mount the screens on. These screens are typically
  larger-format than the screens used within the arena.

  # from comp/arena/screens-drivers.yaml
  ## Organise drivers for the arena screens

  We have screens around the arena to display live information, these
  need something to drive them.

  In the past this has been Raspberry Pis displaying a web-page. If
  this is used again then the following things need doing:
   * Ensure we have enough Pis that work
   * Ensure we have enough Pi power supplies that work
   * Pre-load the Pis SD cards with the proper OS
   * Label each Pi with where it will be deployed (e.g: Arena B, Corner 1)
   * Ensure the Pis will have a suitable name/address on the network

  # from comp/livestream/local.yaml
  ## Show the live stream within the venue

  We should ensure the live stream of the competition is viewable within
  the venue. This enables everyone to see matches without actually being
  arena-side.

  In the past the display has included a split-screen view of all the
  arenas which most people liked. It would be good to do this again.
