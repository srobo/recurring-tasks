description: >-
  On the morning of the first day, teams are given a chance to tinker with
  their robots in the arenas. We're going to use a whiteboard to schedule this.
  Someone will be near the arena and will write teams into 15 minute time
  slots. Requires 1 Blueshirt to manage scheduling and changover.

  Also requires that there is some kind of PA system that is audible in the
  Arena.
