  We need to ensure teams know the important details of the competition


  This must also include informing teams (probably by email) that photography and filming will take at the event,
  to comply with our media consent policy.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Inform teams of the media consent policy
   - [ ] Publish the day schedule on the website
   - [ ] Publish map of parking and directions to venue on website
   - [ ] Publish maps of the competition layout (including team pit locations) on the website
   - [ ] Find out the number of competitors each team will bring
   - [ ] Find out if any teams have any specific requirements in the venue (e.g: accessibility)
   - [ ] Find out what mode of transport teams are using on the Saturday morning (so we know who we expected to be delayed by trains, motorways, etc.)

  - comp/day-schedule
  - comp/venue/layout
