  # from comp/website/schedule-day.yaml
  ## Publish day schedule on website

  The schedule for the days needs to be published on the website so
  people know what's going on.

  # from comp/website/directions.yaml
  ## Put directions to the venue on the website

  To make things easier for teams, we should publish a map and some
  directions to the venue on the website.

  # from comp/venue/layout-map.yaml
  ## Publish $SRYYYY layout maps

  We should have maps of the layout for reference. This should
  include maps with team locations.

  This should be put on the website. If we are publishing a competition
  booklet or flyer then it should be considered for inclusion there too.
