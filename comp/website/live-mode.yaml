summary: Switch the website (proxy) to Competition Live mode for the $SRYYYY competition

priority: should

component: Website

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition Day

area-owner: game

description: >-
  There may be website alterations to be made to the competition website
  before the competition, such as adding an embed to the livestream.
  This link will need to be changed for the second day of the competition.


  During the competition, the website proxy should be switched to use
  the competition live homepage instead of the normal one.
  This normally happens on the morning of the competition.


  After the competition, the website proxy should be switched back to using
  the normal website homepage instead of the competition live one.
  This normally happens on the morning following the competition.


  Toggling the website proxy is done by changing the `enable_competition_homepage`
  setting in the ansible configuration: https://github.com/srobo/ansible/blob/main/group_vars/all.yml#L23


  To simplify the process, both changing to and from the competition live homepage should have PRs created before the competition starts.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Add an embed for the livestream day 1
   - [ ] Create a PR to add the embed for the livestream day 2
   - [ ] Create a PR to switch the website proxy to use the competition live homepage
   - [ ] Create a PR to switch the website proxy to use the normal homepage
   - [ ] Add all three PRs to the project board
