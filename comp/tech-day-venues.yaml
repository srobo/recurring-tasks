description: >-
  Each year we run a series of tech days to help teams prepare for the
  competition. We should plan these days and make sure that we have enough
  volunteers to run them.


  Ideally we should have planned the tech days before Kickstart, so that we can
  advertise them to the teams.


  This task is about planning the tech days. We should include:
   - The number of tech days we want to run
   - The dates of the tech days
   - The location of the tech days
   - The number of volunteers we need to run the tech days
   - The number of teams we can support at each tech day

  For each tech day we should also make sure that we have:
   - A safeguarding officer (Email the Safeguarding Lead to coordinate this.)
   - A risk assessment
   - A process for recording incidents that occur during the tech day

  Required actions:
   - [ ] Plan the tech days
     - [ ] Update the risk assessment for the tech day
     - [ ] Publish the risk assessment to schools
     - [ ] Appoint safeguarding officers for each tech day
   - [ ] Advertise the tech days to the teams
   - [ ] Organise venues for the tech days
   - [ ] Make sure we have enough volunteers to run the tech days
