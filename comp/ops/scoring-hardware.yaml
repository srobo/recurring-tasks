  ## Organise machine to run score entry

  This ticket relates to providing the actual machine that will be
  used by the score entry volunteers.

  This needs to be a machine capable of running the score-entry software
  locally, so probably running a linux, and will need access to the
  competition network.

  Included in this is provision for a screen, keyboard & mouse. If the machine
  is a laptop then that simplifies this greatly, though an external mouse
  should still be provided.

  # from comp/ops/deploy-score-entry.yaml
  ## Deploy the score entry system

  The machine which will be used for score entry need setting up.
  At least one of these is expected to be a permanent machine placement.

  This should also include confirming that the relevant pages and ops
  software things can be accessed.
