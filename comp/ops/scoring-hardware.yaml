  In order to enter the data from the scoring sheets into the competition software,
  we need a machine that can be left in score-entry for the duration of the competition.


  This needs to be capable of running the score-entry software locally,
  so probably running a linux, and will need access to the competition network.


  This machine needs setting up with the score-entry software and, once in the venue, we should confirm that it can access the relevant pages of the compbox.

dependencies:
  - comp/ops/score-entry
