description: >-
    We have a Raspberry Pi 3 (part code `srL1CX`) which is typically used
    as the compbox.

    This task is to prepare the micro SD card and validate that the Pi itself
    functions, so that deployment in the venue is as simple as plugging the Pi
    into the competition network.

    The steps here are usually:

    1. Flash the SD card with the latest Raspbian stable

    2. Clone https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/srcomp-puppet onto the Pi

    3. Run `srcomp-puppet/scripts/install` on the Pi

    4. Use the `scripts/check-pages.py` to validate from outside the Pi that
    the expected pages can be reached
