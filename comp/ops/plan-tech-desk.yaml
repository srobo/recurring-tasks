  Ensure we have enough table top space, power and networking for all necessary equipment at the tech desk.

  For the past few years, the tech desk has been inside the venue's tech booth and contained:
   - Networking
   - Radio charging
   - Lighting desk
   - Sound desk
   - Computers for:
     - compbox
     - Non-sync audio (background music not running through mixtape)
     - sync audio (currently [mixtape](https://github.com/srobo/srcomp-mixtape))

  The livestream have had a pair of tables near the arena, but far enough away to not be too loud.

  A separate 1-2 tables near the arena and staging have contained:
   - Event scoring control + printing
   - Judging
   - Score-entry
