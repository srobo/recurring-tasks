milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

    This ticket relates to providing the actual machine that will be
    used by the score entry volunteers.

    This needs to be a machine capable of running the score-entry software
    locally, so probably running a linux, and will need access to the
    competition network.

    Included in this is provision for a screen, keyboard & mouse. If the machine
    is a laptop then that simplifies this greatly, though an external mouse
    should still be provided.
