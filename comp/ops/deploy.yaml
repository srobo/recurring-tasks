summary: Deploy Ops for the $SRYYYY Competition

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition Day

area-owner: game

description: >-
    Ops needs a table and network connection to work from. It should be
    located somewhere protected from the competitors, but vaguely near
    the arena so the people manning it can see what's going on and easily
    communicate with Score Entry and the Head Judge.

dependencies:
    - comp/ops/compstate
    - comp/ops/deploy-compbox
    - comp/ops/deploy-score-entry
