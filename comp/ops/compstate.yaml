  ## Prepare the $SRYYYY compstate

  The competition software has state about the competition which is used to
  drive the matches, live displays of scores (etc.) both within the venue on
  the website.

  This task is to create the initial state for the competition; see
  https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/srcomp/wiki/Competition-Preparation#create-a-compstate
  and https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Acompstate+org%3Asrobo&type=Repositories.

  # from comp/game/score-format.yaml
  ## Create $SRYYYY game score format

  The format for the game data YAML files which record match outcomes
  needs to be designed.

  There is guidance for how to do this for SRComp at
  https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/srcomp/wiki/Competition-Preparation#configure-game-scoring

  # from comp/game/score-script.yaml
  ## Write scoring scripts for the $SRYYYY game

  The scoring script provides automatic computation of the scores based on the
  data input from the score sheets.

  See https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/srcomp/wiki/Competition-Preparation#implement-scorepy for details.

  # from comp/ops/teams-import.yaml
  ## Import the (final) teams data into the compstate

  We need to run the teams import into the compstate as part of the
  setup so that it's got the latest team images.

  This import may also need re-running during the competition.
