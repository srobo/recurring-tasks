summary: Setup the compstate for the $SRYYYY game

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: game

description: >-
  The competition software has state about the competition which is used to drive the matches,
  live displays of scores (etc.) both within the venue and on the website.


  This task includes creating the initial state for the competition; see
  https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/srcomp/wiki/Competition-Preparation#create-a-compstate
  and https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Acompstate+org%3Asrobo&type=Repositories.


  Alongside this, the format for the game data YAML files which record match outcomes and the script used to calculate the scores needs to be designed.
  There is guidance for how to do the former for SRComp at
  https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/srcomp/wiki/Competition-Preparation#configure-game-scoring
  See https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/srcomp/wiki/Competition-Preparation#implement-scorepy for details of the latter.


  To complete the compstate we need to import the teams and schedule data.
  This may also need to be done again at the competition.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Generate the initial compstate
   - [ ] Create the match scoring YAML format
   - [ ] Create the scoring logic
   - [ ] Import the schedule into the compstate

dependencies:
  - comp/day-schedule
  - comp/game/match-schedule
