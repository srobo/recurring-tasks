  The competition software is used to drive the live displays of scores, etc.


  For the virtual competition, we have a single compbox running in the cloud.
  This is used to drive the livestream and the live scores on the website.


  For the competition, we have two separate compboxes, one in the venue and on in the cloud.
  The displays connected to the comp network (those around the arena) will use the local compbox and those outside this network will use the remote compbox.


  The remote compbox has historically been a Cloud VM running the latest Ubuntu LTS configured using https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/srcomp-puppet.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Deploy the public compbox
