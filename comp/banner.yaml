  For the $SRYYYY competition, we need to have a banner to display at the event.
  This should contain the logos of all the Silver tier (and above) sponsors for the event.


  Nominally, the banner is 6m wide and 1m tall. It is usually displayed at the entrance and prize-giving ceremony.
  It is also used in the group photo.

  
  For SR2025, the banner was 6m by 0.93m as this is the height of the stage in the Cube at SUSU.
  This means that it fits better and is much easier to attach.


  Banner designs from previous years can be found [here](https://github.com/srobo/promotional-material/tree/main/banner)


  Our usual supplier is [Banner World](https://bannerworld.co.uk) where we order an [Event Banner](https://www.bannerworld.co.uk/product/event-banners/).
  We use the 'Hem and Eyelets' Finishing option and select the digital proof option so we can ensure it looks correct before they make it.
