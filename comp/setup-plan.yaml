  We have a limited amount of time to set up the competition, so we need
  to plan what order things needs doing.


  This primarily involves setting up the arena and its surroundings,
  but also includes setting up the pit area and ancillary areas (such as helpdesk and reception).


  An example schedule is given below, but this will need to be updated
  each year.

   - Phase 1: Arena setup
     - Setup minimal network
     - Rig top camera
     - Lay arena carpet
     - Assemble arena walls
     - Run power to arena
     - Run network to arena corners
     - Mount corner screens
     - Complete any arena props
     - Tape out floor markings
     - Mount wall markers
     - Mark starting positions
   - Phase 2: Pit setup
     - Clear pit areas
     - Setup pit tables & chairs
     - Label pit tables
     - Setup pit power
     - Setup pit display screens
   - Phase 3: Setup AV tech
     - Setup arena lighting
     - Setup and test automated AV
     - Test competition software
     - Setup livestream
   - Phase 4: Setup test arena
     - Repeat arena setup for the test arena
   - Phase 5: Setup other areas
     - Setup helpdesk and battery charging
     - Setup power tools area
     - Setup reception
     - Add barriers around the arena
     - Setup phones
   - Phase 6: Training
     - Train marshals
     - Train shepherds
     - Train helpdesk

  Realistically, we'll need to do some of these things in parallel, but
  this gives an idea of the order things need doing in.
