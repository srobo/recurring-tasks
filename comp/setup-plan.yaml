  We need to plan tasks for the setup days

  ## TODO example setup schedule here

  # from comp/arena/build.yaml
  ## Build the arenas

  Build some arenas for the games.

  This covers the physical construction of the arenas, including props
  needed for the game and markings for the start-position of any
  which are moveable. The arenas should also be marked so it's clear
  which is which.

  # from comp/arena/barriers.yaml
  ## Put crowd barriers around the arenas

  Since SR2015 we have used short wood-only walls for the actual arenas
  and had separate crowd barriers around the arena area (including the
  staging area).

  We need to ensure that these barriers are procured in advance and then
  put into place before the first matches.

  Since SR2022 we have used rope barriers instead of crowd barriers.

  # from comp/arena/screens.yaml
  ## Put up screens around the arenas

  We have screens around the arena to display live information, these
  need putting up.

  # from comp/arena/network.yaml
  ## Provide network to the arena

  The arena needs network for the screens and score entry.

  # from comp/arena/power.yaml
  ## Provide power to the arenas

  The arenas need power for displays.

  # from comp/arena/staging-area.yaml
  ## Put out the staging area

  Build the staging area for the arenas, where the teams will attach
  and remove the robot-flags and competition-mode USB keys.

  This should be designed as a one-way system, and include two sets of
  tables:
    * for the robots to placed on while waiting for their match (which
      should have sections labelled per-arena and -corner), used to mount
      the robot flags and for inspection if needed
    * for the robots to be placed on after a match to have their flags
      removed

  The second set of tables should also have a storage area for the
  flags and USB keys, arranged such that it's clear which ones are
  present. A volunteer should be assigned to managed this.

  # from comp/pits/labels.yaml
  ## Furnish each pit with a clearly visible label

  Each pit should have a large visible label so it's clear who is where.
  While maps help, having a label makes things easier for shepherds
  and reduces the chances that a team will move desks.

  It has been suggested that these could be on sticks so they can be
  seen over the heads of the people in the pit.

  # from comp/pits/main.yaml
  ## Prepare team pits at the competition

  Teams need team pits to work in, and these need setting up.

  # from comp/pits/rollout.yaml
  ## Roll out at team pits at the competition

  # from comp/pits/power.yaml
  ## Provide power to all team pits

  All the team pits and related areas need power provided.

  # from comp/pits/power-tools.yaml
  ## Set up a power tools area

  Rather than letting teams use power tools in their team pits, we ask
  them to go to a separate area.

  # from comp/venue/power.yaml
  ## Ensure there is power at the $SRYYYY competition

  For pretty much everything we do, we need power.

  # from comp/setup.yaml
  ## Install things on the set-up day
