  To run the competition each year, we need a set of equipment.
  This is a combination of items that can be reused each year, stored in the container, and consumables that we may need to purchase.

  Well before the competition we'll need to visit storage, to check quantities of consumables (tape etc.) and check the condition of other items.
  We should also create a detailed list of the quantities and competition locations that they need to be delivered to.

  The items we should check for are:
   - [ ] Robot flag fittings, 1 per team order extras from [Screwfix 15mm Speedfit fittings](https://www.screwfix.com/p/jg-speedfit-pem0215w-l-equal-tee-white-15-x-15-x-15mm-5-pack/74470)
   - [ ] Robot flags, 2 for each corner
   - [ ] Tape quantities
     * [ ] A few rolls of white gaff
     * [ ] A few rolls of black gaff
     * [ ] A roll of neon yellow, orange, green, pink gaff each
     * [ ] A few rolls of electrical tape
     * [ ] A roll of red electrical tape
     * [ ] A rolll hazard tape
     * [ ] 2 rolls of NEC carpet tape
   - [ ] 4+ clipboards
   - [ ] Pens, just buy these each year
   - [ ] A box file, for completed scoring forms
   - [ ] High-vis jackets, 1 per team for safety signoffs
   - [ ] Comp mode USBs, 2 for each corner

   - [ ] Red lanyards for media consent
   - [ ] Printer and ink, at least 1 full cartridge
   - [ ] The display & compbox Pis (in RUB sr0J62), collect this box for flashing in advance

  Whilst at storage, we could pre-pack these items ready for transport to the competition.

  The logistics list will then be used at the setup to collect the items from the container and delivered to each area at the competition.

  Required actions:
   - [ ] Visit container to check what needs ordering
   - [ ] Visit container pre-pack boxes
   - [ ] Purchase any required items
   - [ ] Take items to the competition and distribute to the areas that they are needed
