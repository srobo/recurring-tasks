  ## Pre competition storage trip

  We'll need to visit storage at some point before the competition, to check quantities of consumables
  (tape etc.) and to pick up other things which need checking/fixing/updating etc.
  This task exists to track the things we should do on that trip.

   - [ ] Collect the display Pis for checking & flashing
   - [ ] Collect the compbox Pi for checking & flashing
   - [ ] Check for robot flag fittings
   - [ ] Check tape quantities
   - [ ] Check on stationery
   - [ ] Check on high-vis jackets

  Please do add to the above list.

  # from comp/venue/transport/work-out.yaml
  ## Work out what we need from storage at the competition

  We need a list of items which should be collected from storage.

  This should be in a format which can easily be used at the storage location.
  Thus it should:

   - be easily available offline
   - be arranged around the items to collect (rather than e.g: where they should go)
   - describe the important properties of those items (e.g: distinguish desk mount vs scaff mount monitors)
   - (where possible) be grouped into units which match how things are arranged in storage
     - no duplication of similar items (use quantities instead)
     - indicate boxes to grab where items are known to be grouped together (e.g: "box of arena Pis: sr1A2B"),
       but do clarify the expected contents (e.g: "1× Pi 3B, 4× Pi 1B")

  # from comp/arena/tape.yaml
  ## Acquire tape for the $SRYYYY arenas

  For the competition we will need particular tapes:
   * white
   * black
   * neon yellow, blue, green, pink
   * hazard
   * double-sided for laying the carpet with

  We should check what stocks we have and order more if needed.

  # from comp/venue/printer.yaml
  ## Arrange a printer for the competition

  In case we need to print out MCFs/game lists/whatever at high speed.

  # from comp/venue/cable-protectors.yaml
  ## Organise cable protectors

  It's a bad idea to have loose cables trailing around on the floor.
  We should hire cable protectors to cover the cables anywhere necessary.

  Note when ordering them: it turns out to be easier to setup shorter
  runs than longer ones. As a result where runs pass under tables (etc.)
  we should get several short pieces rather than single long ones.

  # from comp/safety/hi-vis.yaml
  ## Organise high-vis jackets for the teams at the competition

  At the competition we use high-vis jackets to signify that a robot
  has passed the safety checks and which member of the team is responsible
  for the robot.

  As only a team member wearing the high-vis jacket may enter the staging
  area, this keeps the number of people in the staging area low while making
  it exceedingly clear who to talk to about each robot.

  We need to ensure that
    - we have enough jackets for all the teams
    - the jackets are marked clearly with the teams' TLAs (both front and back)

  Printouts safety-pinned to the jackets are usually a good way to add the TLAs.

  # from comp/reception/tablecloths.yaml
  ## Source tablecloths for the reception desks

  The reception desks are among the first things which anyone will see
  when arriving at the competition. So that we give a good impression,
  we should therefore ensure that they look good.

  We need some tablecloths, ideally branded with the SR logo, which can
  be used to cover these tables.

  # from comp/game/robot-flag-mounts.yaml
  ## Purchase spare robot flag mounting hardware

  During matches robots are given coloured flags so that the audience know which
  robot is from which scoring zone.

  We expect that not all teams will have suitable mounts for flags. To
  allow for this we should therefore obtain some mounting components they can
  use. We already own a hot glue gun, though we may need to get some more glue
  sticks. The mounting component has historically been
