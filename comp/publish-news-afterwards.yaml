description: >-
  After the competition we want to have a news article which describes how the
  event went, which teams won, etc. This should have been mostly written before
  the competition and then populated with details as needed.

  Once published we should link various people to the article, including:
    * Our social media accounts
    * Various tech/STEM blogs and other media outlets (we should email them)
