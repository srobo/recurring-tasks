summary: Plan the $SRYYYY virtual competition

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition Prep

area-owner: simulator

description: >-
  For the virtual competition, all the matches need to be simulated in advance.
  Running the simulation at reasonable speed requires a reasonably powerful
  computer with a discrete GPU.


  We need to plan how we'll run the virtual competition and potentially have a
  run-through to check the setup works.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Decide when the simulations will be run
   - [ ] Plan how the match schedule will be generated
   - [ ] Set a deadline for code submissions
   - [ ] Decide how many appearances each team will have and the weighting of the virtual competition matches. This is likely to mostly be decided by the rules and day schedule 
   - [ ] Assign key roles for the Virtual Competition
     - [ ] Event director (also responsible for the planning)
     - [ ] Producer
     - [ ] Presenters × 2
     - [ ] Simulator runner
     - [ ] Scores/background preparers × 2/3
     - [ ] Chat moderators
     - [ ] Safeguarding officer
    - [ ] Plan how to get logs, animations & videos out to teams after the event
