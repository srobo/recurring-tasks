description: >-
  For the virtual competition, all the matches need to be simulated in advance.
  Running the simulation at reasonable speed requires a reasonably powerful
  computer with a discrete GPU.

  Once the simulation is complete, the videos need to be sent to the livestream
  producer so that they can be played during the livestream.
