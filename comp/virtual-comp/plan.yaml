summary: Plan the $SRYYYY virtual competition

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition Prep

area-owner: simulator

description: >-
  For the virtual competition, all the matches need to be simulated in advance.
  Running the simulation at reasonable speed requires a reasonably powerful
  computer with a discrete GPU.


  We need to plan how we'll run the virtual competition and potentially have a
  run-through to check the setup works.


  Required actions:
   - [ ] Decide who will run the simulation
   - [ ] Decide when the simulations will be run
   - [ ] Plan how the match schedule will be generated
   - [ ] Set a deadline for code submissions
