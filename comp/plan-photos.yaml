description: >-
  We want to have a good set of photos from the competition to use in news
  articles, social media, etc. We should plan what photos we want to take and
  who will take them.


  This task is about planning the photos to be taken. We should include:
   * A photo of each team with and without their robot (ideally with their TLA
     visible) - this is a good opportunity for them to show off their team image
      and for us to associate the robot with the team
   * A photo with all the teams and their robots - this is generally useful for
     publicity and for looking back on previous years to see which robots competed
   * A photo of all the Blueshirts - this is useful for promoting volunteering at
     the competition
   * Photos of the competition in progress
   * Photos of the prizegiving
   * Photos of the winning teams
   * Photos of the robots
   * Photos of the robots in the arena

   - [ ] Decide what photos we want to take
   - [ ] Decide who will take each photo
