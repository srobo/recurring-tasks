  In SR2023 this consisted of four individual desks arranged such that
  one was on each side of two lanes. Each lane had its own queue and
  rope barrier was used to divide them. At the desk, teams signed in
  and handed over their batteries and chargers. They were then
  directed to their pit area.

  A small number of additional volunteers were also placed around the
  desks to direct people towards their proper pit area.
