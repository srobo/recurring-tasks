  This is needed for entry control.

  In SR2015 this consisted of four individual desks arranged such that
  one was on each side of two lanes. Each desk had its own queue, and
  one was reserverd for special-case handling (e.g: competitors without
  tickets). Crowd barriers were used to enforce these queues.

  A volunteer was stationed on the door reminding people of the things
  they needed to hand over (ticket, batteries, charger), which further
  improved things.

  On each desk the validation of tickets was separated from the crimping
  of the wristbands, with a different volunteer manning each. A small
  number of additional volunteers were also placed around the desks to
  direct people towards their proper pit area.
