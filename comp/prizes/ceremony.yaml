  ## Organise the $SRYYYY post-finals sequence

  At the end of the competition we want to give out some prizes. We need to plan
  how we will transition from the finals, through any speeches and run the
  actual prize-giving ceremony.

  We should ensure that anyone who is speaking (whether a volunteer or a guest
  speaker) knows how long they have, what we're expecting them to talk about and
  is well rehearsed.

  We should include (somewhere) thanks to various people: teams, volunteers,
  sponsors, etc.

  # from comp/prizes/envelopes.yaml
  ## Get envelopes & card for the prize ceremony

  We like to put the results on pieces of card, inside envelopes, to add a
  sense of drama to the prize ceremony. We need to source that card and
  envelopes and then print the SR logo onto them.

  These will need to be kept safe until the knockouts, during which they will
  have the awards written onto them.

  # from comp/prizes/speaker.yaml
  ## Arrange a speaker for the prize ceremony

  This should be someone involved in technology and who the competitors
  can recognise as such. Extra points if the person is actually famous.

  Once invited and confirmed we should consider adding the person's name
  or title to the publicity materials being prepared for the competition.

  # from comp/prizes/rehearsal.yaml
  ## Have a rehearsal of the post-finals sequence

  At the end of the competition we want to give out some prizes. We need to
  rehearse how we will transition from the finals, through any speeches and run
  the actual prize-giving ceremony.
