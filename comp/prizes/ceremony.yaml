summary: Organise the prize ceremony for the $SRYYYY competition

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: production

description: >-
  At the end of the competition we want to give out some prizes. We need to plan
  how we will transition from the finals, through any speeches and run the
  actual prize-giving ceremony.


  We should ensure that anyone who is speaking (whether a volunteer or a guest
  speaker) knows how long they have, what we're expecting them to talk about and
  is well rehearsed.


  We should include (somewhere) thanks to various people: teams, volunteers,
  sponsors, etc.


  We like to put the results on pieces of card, inside envelopes, to make the prize ceremony look more professional.
  We need to source the cards and envelopes with the SR logo on them.


  The speaker for the prize ceremony should be someone involved in technology and who the competitors can recognise as such.


  To make sure that the prize ceremony runs smoothly, we should have a rehearsal of the prize-giving ceremony.
