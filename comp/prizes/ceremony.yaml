milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  At the end of the competition we want to give out some prizes. We need to plan
  how we will transition from the finals, through any speeches and run the
  actual prize-giving ceremony.

  We should ensure that anyone who is speaking (whether a volunteer or a guest
  speaker) knows how long they have, what we're expecting them to talk about and
  is well rehearsed.

  We should include (somewhere) thanks to various people: teams, volunteers,
  sponsors, etc.
