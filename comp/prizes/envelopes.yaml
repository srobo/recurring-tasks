summary: Get envelopes & card for the prize ceremony

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
    We like to put the results on pieces of card, inside envelopes, to add a
    sense of drama to the prize ceremony. We need to source that card and
    envelopes and then print the SR logo onto them.

    These will need to be kept safe until the knockouts, during which they will
    have the awards written onto them.
