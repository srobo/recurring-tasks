priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

  The prizes for the competition are a combination of trophies and edible prizes.
  This task only considers the trophies; there is a separate task for edible prizes.


  Generally we have three sizes of trophies, one for each of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.
  The remaining trophies are a mixture of the medium and small sizes.
  We may also want a 4th place prize for the remaining other finalist.


  For the past few years the trophies have had the SR logo and "Student Robotics" written on them.
  [SR Logo with stacked text](https://github.com/srobo/promotional-material/blob/main/SR%20Logo%20with%20stacked%20text.svg) is this logo.
  Note that in the past some suppliers had issues with it being an svg, so you may want to convert it to pdf before using it.
