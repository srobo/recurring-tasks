summary: Create a list of return destinations for everything

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  We need a plan of what is going to be returned to where after the
  competition, ideally with in-venue holding areas identified for each
  return destination.

  As the sources of items are not in general known (and so cannot be
  included here directly), sub-tasks for each destination should be
  added to this task each year.
