description: >-
  The layout of team pits in the venue needs to be worked out. There are
  constraints such as keeping teams under the same teacher close
  together, and keeping overseas teams near each other.

  This task covers both the placement of the pits within the venue and the
  allocation of specific teams to pits.

  Ideally the pits should be internally numbered and kept with an ordered list
  of teams which fit to those locations. This helps ensure that the compstate
  can easily be kept in step with the physical locations of each team.
