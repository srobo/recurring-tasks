description: >-
  We'll want a collection of rules for the competitors on the day.
  In the past this has included rules about where power tools and paint
  (etc.) can be used so we don't break the venue as well as reminders
  about staging and not going in the arena during matches. Also a map
  of the venue.


  Ideally these should be displayed somewhere the competitors can read
  them, without being placed somewhere they'll end up hiding when they
  arrive and put their kit down.


  They also need to be short enough that the competitors actually read
  through them.
