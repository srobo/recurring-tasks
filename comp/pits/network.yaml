  Teams need access to the internet to use the IDE and get at
  documentation. We therefore need network access in all the team pits.

  Past experience with WiFi-only network provision has been mixed, so hard-wire
  network provision should be considered unless the venue has well proven
  capacity.

  Some venues' internet provision requires the use of guest accounts. If these
  are needed, We should ensure (as part of this task or by adding a sub-task)
  that suitable accounts are obtained, ideally at least per-team as well as for
  volunteers.
