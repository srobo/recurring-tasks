summary: Plan overnight kit & battery loans at the competition

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: kit

description: >-
  Many teams will want to take their kits home with them overnight at
  the competition, in order to work on them. We usually require these
  teams to fill in some paperwork to record this, in order to ensure we
  know which team have done this and which parts they have taken with
  them. The latter is important as they will likely not be taking with
  them the same batteries as they had for the rest of the year and so
  the inventory will not track this loan.

  for details.
