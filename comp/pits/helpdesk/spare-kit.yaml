summary: Have spare kit available at the competition

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

area-owner: kit

description: >-
  If kit breaks at the competition for teams, we should be prepared to
  replace it at high speed. For that we will need hot spares.

  Ideally this kit should be kept at Helpdesk. Helpdesk should at least be
  informed of the policy for replacing kit.
