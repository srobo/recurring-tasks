summary: Send kit disclaimer forms to team leaders

priority: minor

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Kickstart

area-owner: kit

description: >-
    As the kits contain valuable and potentially dangerous components, many of
    which are not CE marked, we normally ask the team leaders to sign a form
    accepting responsibility for it and promising to return it at the end of the
    year.

    We should send (digital) copies of the form to team leaders so that they can
    sign & return the forms ahead of time, simplifying things at kickstart.
