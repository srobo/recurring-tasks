description: >-
    After the kickstart we want to have a news article which describes how the
    event went and continues to build up the excitement around the comptition.
    To ensure we have a news article ready to go we should write a skeleton
    article before the kickstart and then fill in the details as needed.


    Things we should mention:
     - that we had N locations, the number of teams who attended, etc.
     - anything particularly interesting from the days (optional; if such things happen)
     - a link to the rulebook (it'll probably be in the usual place in the docs)
     - a summary of the game
     - a link to the kickstart microgames

    Once published we should link various people to the article, including:
     - Our social media accounts
     - Various tech/STEM blogs and other media outlets (we should email them)

    Required actions:
     - [ ] Write a skeleton article before the kickstart
     - [ ] Publish the article after the kickstart
     - [ ] Link to the article from our social media accounts
     - [ ] Email various tech/STEM blogs and other media outlets with a link to the article
