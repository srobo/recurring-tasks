summary: Prepare a livestream for the $SRYYYY Kickstart

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Kickstart

area-owner: livestream

description: >-
    To allow teams to watch the kickstart remotely, and particularly now we do
    virtual kickstarts, we need to livestream the event.

    To do this we need a machine to run the livestream, and a plan for how the
    livestream will be run.

    Generally this livestream has the presenters and producers in separate locations,
    so the producer's machine will normally be used to run the livestream.

    The livestream generally consists of the Kickstart presentation, and the
    presenter's camera feed.

    Required actions:
     - [ ] Decide who will run the livestream
     - [ ] Create the required scenes in OBS
     - [ ] Generate a livestream link to be shared with teams
     - [ ] Test using remote cameras
     - [ ] Practice running the livestream
