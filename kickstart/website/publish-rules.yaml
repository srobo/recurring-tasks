    ## Archive the rules for the $SRYYYY game

    Move the rules from the [rules](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules) page
    to the [game archive](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules/archive) in the
    docs, making way for the new rules to be published.

    # from kickstart/website/publish-rules.yaml
    ## Publish the rules for the $SRYYYY game

    These need building and the website patching.
    The [rules](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules) page will need updating
    to show that the rules have been published and the link and image updating.

dependencies:
    - kickstart/rules/write
