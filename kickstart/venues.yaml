    In order to have the $SRYYYY Kickstarts we need venues to have it in.

    Each venue should expect to host at least four teams, have a way to give a
    presentation (i.e: have a large screen or projector) and be able to provide
    for each team:
     - a large desk to work on and sit around
     - power & internet access (if the latter is via computers that's ideal,
       but not required)

    We should balance the number of Kickstart venues with our ability to staff
    them. This is as much about ensuring we have a couple of experienced
    Blueshirts at each one as it is about overall numbers.

    Note: each venue is encouraged to make a dependent subtask of this one
    so that per-venue disucssion and tracking is clear.
