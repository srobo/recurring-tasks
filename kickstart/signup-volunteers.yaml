    To run the competition programme we need volunteers to help us.
    This includes people to help run the Kickstart, help plan the
    competition & tech days, and help run the competition.


    We should make a signup form to capture contact details and what
    people are interested in helping with. We should then send this
    out to the mailing list and advertise it on Slack.


    We should also send out a reminder email to volunteers with the
    final details of the Kickstart.


    Required actions:
     - [ ] Create a signup form for volunteers
     - [ ] Advertise the signup form to potential volunteers, e.g. on Slack and by email

dependencies:
  - comp/announce
