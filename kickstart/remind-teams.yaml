description: |
    We need to remind team leaders that the kickstart is happening, communicate
    the final details and encourage them to prepare for it on their end.

    We should tell them:
     * What venue to come to
     * What time to arrive
     * That they should pre-create competitor user accounts
     * To bring their signed disclaimer forms (optional; if we sent them out)

dependencies:
    - kickstart/confirm-teams
    - kickstart/venues
