priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Kickstart

description: >-
    We need to remind team leaders that the kickstart is happening, communicate
    the final details and encourage them to prepare for it on their end.

    We should tell them:
    * What venue to come to
    * What time to arrive
    * That they should pre-create competitor user accounts
    * To bring their signed disclaimer forms (optional; if we sent them out)

dependencies:
    - kickstart/confirm-teams
    - kickstart/venues
