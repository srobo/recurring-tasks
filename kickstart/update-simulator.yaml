summary: Update the simulator for the $SRYYYY game

priority: must

component: Rules

milestone: $SRYYYY Kickstart

area-owner: simulator

description: >-
    The $SRYYYY game will be different to that for the previous year,
    so the arena template in the simulator will need updating.
    The MARKER_* items will also be different, so they'll need updating
    as well.


    While this can be worked on ahead of time we should clearly avoid
    actually publishing it until Kickstart.


    Required actions:
     - [ ] Update the simulator for the $SRYYYY game
     - [ ] Update the simulator docs to reflect any changes
     - [ ] Publish the simulator for the $SRYYYY game

dependencies:
    - kickstart/create-game
