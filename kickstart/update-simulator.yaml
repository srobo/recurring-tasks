summary: Update the simulator for the $SRYYYY game

priority: should

component: Rules

milestone: $SRYYYY Kickstart

area-owner: simulator

description: >-
    The $SRYYYY game will be different to that for the previous year,
    so the arena template in the simulator will need updating.
    The MARKER_* items will also be different, so they'll need updating
    as well.

    While this can be worked on ahead of time we should clearly avoid
    actually publishing it until Kickstart.

dependencies:
    - kickstart/create-game
