summary: Decide on the $SRYYYY game

priority: major

component: Rules

milestone: $SRYYYY Kickstart

description: >-
    The $SRYYYY game will be different to that for the previous year,
    so the arena template in the simulator will need updating.
    The MARKER_* items will also be different, so they'll need updating
    as well.

    While this can be worked on ahead of time we should clearly avoid
    actually publishing it until Kickstart.

dependencies:
    - kickstart/rules/decide-game
    # Ideally this would appear in a 'related' section, but that doesn't exist
    - kickstart/rules/write
