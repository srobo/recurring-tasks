    ## Organise Discord for $SRYYYY

    We provide a Discord server for the teams to use during the year.
    Typically the microgames at Kickstart get the competitors using these,
    so they need to be ready before the event.

    # from kickstart/services/discord.yaml
    ## Set-up Discord for $SRYYYY

    In order to allow the competitors to chat to each other and request help
    from mentors, we setup a Discord server each year.

    The Discord server allows competitors to join by using a common invite link
    and a team specific password. Our Discord bot then assigns them a specific
    team role.

    We usually have three public sections as follows:
     - *Information* (Information about the competition. Only the Admins can post here.)
       - *welcome-and-rules* (The welcome message and server rules.)
       - *Announcements* (Any competition-wide announcements we need to make: rules ammendments, software updates.)
       - *blog* (A feed of the blog posts from the website.)
     - *Support* (A place for competitors to ask for help.)
       - *support* (A forum channel for teams to raise specific issues.)
       - *challenge-submissions* (A forum channel for teams to submit their challenge submission videos.)
       - *quick-questions* (A place for teams to ask quick questions.)

     - *Social* (A place for competitors to chat to each other.)
       - *general* (A general chat channel.)
       - *say-hello* (The channel that welcome messages are posted to.)
       - *off-topic* (A place for competitors to chat about non-competition related things.)
       - *teams-on-the-web* (A place for teams to share their instagram, twitter, blog posts.)
       - *the-stage* (A voice channel for online events.)

    Additionally, we have a private section for each team, which is only
    accessible to the team members and the Blueshirts.

    # from kickstart/services/invite-blueshirts.yaml
    ## Invite Blueshirts to Discord for $SRYYYY

    In order to allow mentors to suppport the competitors on Discord, we need to
    create an invite link and onboarding instructions for them. The link needs
    to be published on Slack before Kickstart.

    # from kickstart/services/invite-teams.yaml
    ## Invite teams to Discord for $SRYYYY

    In order to allow the competitors to use the Discord server we
    provide, we need to give them their team password to allow them
    to be assigned the correct team role.
