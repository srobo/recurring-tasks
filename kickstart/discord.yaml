    In order to allow the competitors to chat to each other and request help
    from mentors, we setup a Discord server each year.


    The Discord server allows competitors to join by using a common invite link
    and a team specific password. Our Discord bot then assigns them a specific
    team role.


    We usually have three public sections as follows:
     - *Information* (Information about the competition. Only the Admins can post here.)
       - *welcome-and-rules* (The welcome message and server rules.)
       - *Announcements* (Any competition-wide announcements we need to make: rules ammendments, software updates.)
       - *blog* (A feed of the blog posts from the website.)
     - *Support* (A place for competitors to ask for help.)
       - *support* (A forum channel for teams to raise specific issues.)
       - *challenge-submissions* (A forum channel for teams to submit their challenge submission videos.)
       - *quick-questions* (A place for teams to ask quick questions.)

     - *Social* (A place for competitors to chat to each other.)
       - *general* (A general chat channel.)
       - *say-hello* (The channel that welcome messages are posted to.)
       - *off-topic* (A place for competitors to chat about non-competition related things.)
       - *teams-on-the-web* (A place for teams to share their instagram, twitter, blog posts.)
       - *the-stage* (A voice channel for online events.)

    Additionally, we have a private section for each team, which is only
    accessible to the team members and the Blueshirts.


    Once the server is setup, we need to create an invite link and team passwords
    for the teams to use. Then we need to invite the Blueshirts to the server.
