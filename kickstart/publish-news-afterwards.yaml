description: >-
    After the kickstart we want to have a news article which describes how the
    event went and continues to build up the excitement around the comptition.
    This should have been mostly written before the competition and then
    populated with details as needed.

    Once published we should link various people to the article, including:
    - Our social media accounts
    - Various tech/STEM blogs and other media outlets (we should email them)

dependencies:

    - kickstart/website/publish-rules
