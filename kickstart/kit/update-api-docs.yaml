    ## Update the API for the $SRYYYY game

    The `sr.robot3` API needs updating to contain the marker details for
    the $SRYYYY game.

    # from kickstart/website/docs.yaml
    ## Update the docs for the $SRYYYY game

    The docs will need updating to match the new API for the $SRYYYY API and
    game, specifically https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/sr/vision/
    and https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/sr/vision/markers, though
    possibly elsewhere.

    # from kickstart/markers.yaml
    ## Create markers for the $SRYYYY game

    We need to generate the fiducial markers used for the $SRYYYY game
    and add them to https://github.com/srobo/game-markers.
    These markers also need adding to the docs (https://github.com/srobo/docs)
    so that competitors can access them for development.
