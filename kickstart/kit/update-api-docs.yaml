    The $SRYYYY game may require changes to the docs.


    While the kit API has a default set of markers, the PDF will need
    regenerating to contain the subset of markers used for the $SRYYYY game,
    with the game-specific names.


    Additionally, there may be changes to the docs that are required for the $SRYYYY game.
    This could include providing focused tutorials relevant to the game mechanics, i.e.:
    building mechanisms to lift tokens, techniques to navigating through tight spaces, etc.


    Required actions:
     - [ ] Update the docs for the $SRYYYY game
     - [ ] Create marker PDF for the $SRYYYY game

dependencies:
    - kickstart/create-game
