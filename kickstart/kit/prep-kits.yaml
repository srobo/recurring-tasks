    confident will function correctly for the full duration of the competition.


    This involves testing and packaging the kits, ready for shipping.


    Required actions:
     - [ ] Collate the kit components received back from teams
     - [ ] Test the kit components
     - [ ] Fix parts, where practical. (i.e. replace broken cases, clean tape residue off)
     - [ ] Package the kits
     - [ ] Pack the kits for shipping
