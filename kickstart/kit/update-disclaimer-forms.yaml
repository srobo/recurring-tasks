summary: Update kit disclaimer forms for $SRYYYY

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Kickstart

area-owner: kit

description: >-
    As the kits contain valuable and potentially dangerous components, many of
    which are not CE marked, we normally ask the team leaders to sign a form
    accepting responsibility for it and promising to return it at the end of the
    year.

    We need to update the form to at least have the right year on it, as well as
    any other changes related to the kits which may have happened.
