description: >-
    Any teams that are not physically attending a Kickstart need their kits
    shipped to them.

    For SR2024 & SR2025 we shipped kits to all teams.


    Historically costs for this were covered by SR, from SR2026 teams have been asked to subsidize the postage costs.


    Addresses will be collected from teams during the signup process.
    Theses addresses will need to be confirmed by email before dispatching a kit.


    Required actions:
     - [ ] Confirm addresses with teams
     - [ ] Record which kits are allocated to which teams
     - [ ] Ship kits to UK teams
     - [ ] Ship kits to overseas teams
