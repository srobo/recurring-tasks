    ## Allocate $SRYYYY kits to teams

    Teams will want kits at Kickstart so we need to know which kits to
    give to each team.

    # from kickstart/kit/ship-kickstarts.yaml
    ## Ship $SRYYYY kits to Kickstarts

    Teams will want kits at Kickstart so we need to ship the relevant kits
    to each of the Kickstart venues.

    # from kickstart/kit/ship-overseas.yaml
    ## Ship $SRYYYY kits to overseas Teams

    Teams overseas need their kits shipped to them. This has mostly been
    the German teams in the past few years, which have been shipped together
    to the German Kickstart. This is intentionally separate from the
    shipping to Kickstarts as it involves an international delivery.

    # from kickstart/kit/ship-courier.yaml
    ## Ship $SRYYYY kits to Teams not attending Kickstarts

    Teams unable to make it to a Kickstart need their kits couriering to
    them.

    Costs for this have historically been covered by SR.

    We require teams to explicitly confirm their address by email before
    dispatching a kit.
