summary: Create microgames for the $SRYYYY Kickstart

priority: should

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Kickstart

area-owner: mentoring

description: >-
    At Kickstart we usually have the teams perform some introductory tasks to
    get them familiar with the kit and to establish that they can safely charge
    their batteries.

    The tasks also help give them a starting point in programming and
    familiarity with asking Blueshirts for help.
