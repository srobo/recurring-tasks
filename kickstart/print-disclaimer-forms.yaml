    As the kits contain valuable and potentially dangerous components, many of
    which are not CE marked, we normally ask the team leaders to sign a form
    accepting responsibility for it and promising to return it at the end of the
    year.

    Once these have been updated, we need to print enough of them for each venue
    to have copies for team leaders to sign.
