description: >-
    For the $SRYYYY Competition Programme, we need to get teams to sign up to
    take part in the competition. Given that we have a limited number of places,
    for the last few years we've only advertised the competition to teams who
    are on our mailing list.


    To accomplish this, we need to create a signup form to collect the institution
    and team supervisor details. Once we have the details, we need to select the
    teams who will be taking part in the competition.


    Any teams who are taking part for the first time will need to be allocated
    a TLA, ideally one that doesn't clash with any existing teams.


    Additionally, as the kits contain potentially dangerous components, many of
    which are not CE marked, we normally ask the team supervisors to sign a form
    accepting responsibility for it.


    We should send (digital) copies of the form to team supervisors so that they
    can sign & return the forms ahead of time.


    Once we have the final plans for Kickstart, we need to send an email to the
    team supervisors so that they can prepare for the event.


    We should aim to tell them:
     - The venue for Kickstart
     - What time to arrive/when the livestream starts
     - That their team members should join the Discord server
     - To send their signed disclaimer forms so that they can get their kits
