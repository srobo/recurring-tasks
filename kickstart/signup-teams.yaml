    # from pre/advertise-teams.yaml
    ## Advertise the $SRYYYY Competition Programme to potential teams
    We need to advertise the existence of the competition programme to people
    who might want to take part.

    # from pre/signups-teams.yaml
    ## Team signups for the $SRYYYY Competition Programme
    We need to get potential teams to sign up to take part in the competition.

    # from kickstart/confim-teams.yaml
    ## Confirm which teams are taking part in $SRYYYY

    We need to inform the teams who have places and invite them to the Kickstart
    venue most suitable for them.

    # from kickstart/allocate-tlas.yaml
    ## Allocate TLAs for $SRYYYY

    Once we've decided which teams are getting places we need to assign them
    their TLAs.

    TLAs should idealy be consistent between years, so that competitors can
    build a brand around their name.

    # from kickstart/remind-teams.yaml
    ## Remind team leaders about the $SRYYYY Kickstart

    We need to remind team leaders that the kickstart is happening, communicate
    the final details and encourage them to prepare for it on their end.

    We should tell them:
     * What venue to come to
     * What time to arrive
     * That they should pre-create competitor user accounts
     * To bring their signed disclaimer forms (optional; if we sent them out)

    # from kickstart/send-disclaimer-forms.yaml
    ## Send kit disclaimer forms to team leaders

    As the kits contain valuable and potentially dangerous components, many of
    which are not CE marked, we normally ask the team leaders to sign a form
    accepting responsibility for it and promising to return it at the end of the
    year.

    We should send (digital) copies of the form to team leaders so that they can
    sign & return the forms ahead of time, simplifying things at kickstart.

    # from kickstart/print-disclaimer-forms.yaml

    Once these have been updated, we need to print enough of them for each venue
    to have copies for team leaders to sign.
