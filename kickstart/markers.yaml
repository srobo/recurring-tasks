summary: Create markers for the $SRYYYY game

priority: major

component: Rules

milestone: $SRYYYY Kickstart

area-owner: game

description: >-
    We need to generate the fiducial markers used for the $SRYYYY game
    and add them to https://github.com/srobo/game-markers.
    The dev markers also need adding to the docs (https://github.com/srobo/docs)
    so that competitors can access them for development.

    Obviously this can't happen until we've decided what the names of
    the markers will be.

dependencies:
    - kickstart/update-api
