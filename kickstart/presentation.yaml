    ## Create kickstart presentation

    Kickstart events require a presentation to go through what student robotics
    is, what the competition cycle looks like, and details of the game.

    1. What Student Robotics is
    2. Who the volunteers are
    3. Schedule for the year
        - How long the competition is
        - Tech days date, time, etc..
    4. General robot design tips

        - The forums
    6. Health and safety
        - How to charge your batteries
