    Kickstart events require a presentation to go through what student robotics
    is, what the competition cycle looks like, and details of the game.

    The presentation needs to be given at each venue, so will be presented by
    multiple people.

    The presentation usually covers:

    1. What student robotics is
    2. Who the volunteers are
    3. Schedule for the year
        - How long the competition is
        - Tech days date, time, etc..
    4. General robot design tips
    5. The kit
        - Hardware
        - Software
        - The docs
        - The forums
    6. Health and safety
        - How to charge your batteries
