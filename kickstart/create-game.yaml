description: >-
    The $SRYYYY game will be different than the previous year's, so we
    need to decide what it will be.

    Note: once decided we still want to keep the choice a secret so it's
    a surprise to teams at Kickstart.

    Once the game is decided, we'll need to generate a set of rules for
    it. This will cover the arena layout, the scoring, and the regulations
    for the robots.

    For the past few years we've also set a set of challenges for the teams
    to complete during the year, to encourage them to begin working on their
    robots early. These include using the vision system, performing accurate
    movements, and a mechanism challenge.

    Required actions:
    - [ ] Decide on the game
    - [ ] Write the rules document
    - [ ] Test the challenges
