    ## Decide on the $SRYYYY game

    The $SRYYYY game will be different than the previous year's, so we
    need to decide what it will be.

    Note: once decided we still want to keep the choice a secret so it's
    a surprise to teams at Kickstart.

    # from kickstart/rules/write.yaml
    ## Write the rules for the $SRYYYY game

    We need to have a game to play in $SRYYYY. It will be different than
    the previous year's, so the rules need updating.
