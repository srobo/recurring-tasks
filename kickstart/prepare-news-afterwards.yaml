description: >-
    After the kickstart we want to have a news article which describes how the
    event went and continues to build up the excitement around the comptition.
    This should have been mostly written before the competition and then
    populated with details as needed.

    Things we should mention:
      * that we had N locations, the number of teams who attended, etc.
      * anything particularly interesting from the days (optional; if such things happen)
      * a link to the rulebook (it'll probably be in the usual place in the docs)
      * a summary of the game
      * a link to the kickstart microgames

    The post-kickstart news article can take some time to write. We should
    write a skeleton one as soon as possible, and just fill in the blanks
    immediately after the kickstart followed by high-speed review and
    shipping.

dependencies:
    - kickstart/confirm-teams
    - kickstart/microgames
    - kickstart/rules/decide-game
