description: >-
    In order to allow the competitors to chat to each other and request help
    from mentors, we setup forums each year. These are typically an instance
    of [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/) hosted on a VM of ours.

    The forums allow login using the competitors' user accounts and when they
    post in the forums, updates are cross-posted into Slack.

    We usually have forums as follows:
     - *General Discussion* (General chitchat.)
     - *Programming* (Python, libraries and concepts.)
     - *Electronics* (Electrons, holes and joules.)
     - *Mechanics* (Pulleys, sprockets, hinges and gudgeon pins.)
     - *Teams on the web* (A place to show off your team blogs, videos, and bat-based memes.)
     - *<name of the game>* (Discussion about the game.)
