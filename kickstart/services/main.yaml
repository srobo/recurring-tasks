summary: Prepare the hosted services for $SRYYYY

priority: blocker

component: sysadmin

milestone: $SRYYYY Kickstart

area-owner: mentoring

description: >-
    We provide a hosted IDE and online forums to the teams to use during the
    year. Typically the microgames at Kickstart get the competitors using these,
    so they need to be ready before the event.

    Our current approach is to spin up a new hosted "pet" machine running the
    `competitor-services` variant of our [puppet configuration][puppet-config].

    [puppet-config]: https://github.com/srobo/server-puppet/tree/patience

dependencies:
    - kickstart/services/forums
    - kickstart/services/ide
    - kickstart/services/user-accounts/mentors
    - kickstart/services/user-accounts/team-leaders
