description: >-
    In order to allow the competitors to use the various hosted services we
    provide, we need to give them user accounts.

    Typically we create the accounts fo the team leaders and let them create the
    accounts for the individual competitors. This task is therefore about the
    user accounts for the team leaders.

    Included in this is creating the neccessary team and school groups within
    the auth system.
